# signzy
Its a flutter project is written in dart. It's a basic fintech solution for all your income and expense statements. It can provide your all debit and credit information without even you logging in your any wallet or bank credentials. It gets all the data from your local messages and emails. Then it segregates all your data into transactional ones and gives you all the demographics including pie and line charts. The architecture used to develop this app is MVVM to keep the code clean. As it is developed in flutter hence it's a cross-platform app for both the android and IOs.
